## Research Questions

### **Working With Tabbed Excel Files**
- **Methodology:** Many datasets, such as those provided in the Native Hawaiian Data Book 2023 (described in the [data](#data) section), are stored in tabbed Excel files, which present challenges for data manipulation. This project will investigate the best approaches for cleaning and unifying this data while preserving its original tabular structure and making it more compatible with modern data science tools.
- **Tracking Cleaning Progress:** A key consideration is how to effectively track the progress of cleaning and unifying large datasets, such as the Native Hawaiian Data Book 2023, which contains over 100 tabs of data. The project will develop methods for easily identifying which data has been processed and what still needs attention.

### **Expanding Data Interactivity**
- **LLM Application:** The project will explore how to leverage Llama 3.1 to create interactive visualizations that allow users to engage with the data conversationally, enhancing traditional data visualizations. The goal is to identify or develop methodologies and frameworks that facilitate this kind of interactivity.
