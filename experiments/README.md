# Experiments
Within this project's overarching goal to centralize, clean, and make data on Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) more accessible and interactive, I also explore more general ideas that help guide development. All are listed and described below.

## Current Experiments

### **Question-Answering Over Numerical Datasets**
This experiment will explore the efficacy of using LLMs to answer questions about numerical datasets. The goal is to determine how well LLMs can understand and respond to questions about data, as well as how effectively they can summarize and analyze that data.

### **Vectorizing Numerical Data for LLMs**
This experiment will investigate the best methods for vectorizing numerical data so that it can be used with LLMs. The goal is to determine how to represent numerical data in a way that is most compatible with LLMs, gaining a better understanding of how to structure data for optimal performance with these models. It is likely that a hybrid approach will be necessary, vectorizing the data but keeping the original data structure intact as well.

### **Leveraging LLMs to Expand Data Interactivity**
This experiment will explore how LLMs can be used to create interactive visualizations that allow users to engage with the data conversationally. The goal is to identify or develop methodologies and frameworks that facilitate this kind of interactivity, enhancing traditional data visualizations and making data more accessible and engaging for a wider audience.

### **Fine-Tuning LLMs for Population Data**
This experiment will focus on the specific requirements for fine-tuning LLMs to work with population data, which may not be as expansive or as diverse as other types of data. The goal is to determine how to optimize LLMs for working with population data, which may require specialized training data and fine-tuning techniques.
